% understanding algorithms - complexity of quicksort
In Figure 9, it is clear that Quicksort was consistent on all but 2 of the arrays it sorted. This is a clear example of how Quicksort can suffer in rare cases.
Because we do not have the ability to look at a long list of numbers and recognize patterns it is not quite as clear \emph{why} the times for those 2 arrays were
greater, but we do have physicaly verification of the lack of consistency that is present with Quicksort. All of the other sorts were relatively smooth across
these graphs.
